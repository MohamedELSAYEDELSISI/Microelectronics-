Decreasing the frequency of the operating LFSR from 1 GHz to 0.5 GHz (or lower) 
to allow the adder to manipulate the data input more frequently and correctly,
ensuring proper synchronization.

There is no difference between the three output sum signals (S1, S2, and S3);
 they produce the same output, even though there is an error in the result
 between 24.5 ns and 24.6 ns.

Analyzing the three outputs (s1, s2, s3):
The outputs (s1 and s2) are the results from two structural architectures, while (s3) is the result from a behavioral architecture.
In most cases, when summing two unsigned numbers, the result is correct. However, in some time periods (e.g., from 24.5 ns to 24.6 ns), the result is incorrect.
