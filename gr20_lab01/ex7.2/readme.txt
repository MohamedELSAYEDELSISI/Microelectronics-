During the synthesis process,the ALU inputs are assumed to be 4-bit wide to avoid excessive complexity in the schematic.
Reports detailing the utilized area and maximum delay are provided in ALU_area.txt and ALU_Timing.txt.
The maximum delay refers to the time interval from when the function signal is applied to when the ALU produces the output,it is the time between we give inputs and when we get the results on the OUTALU signal.
